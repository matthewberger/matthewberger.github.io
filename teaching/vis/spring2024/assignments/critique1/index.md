# Design Critique 1

The purpose of this assignment is to familiarize yourself with Observable notebooks, and start to build a critical perspective on data visualizations.

First and foremost, you should create an account on Observable - choose the **Free Individual** tier. As part of your submission, provide your username, or email you used to register for Observable. This is required for you to be added to the Observable Team for this course, and in turn, complete programming assignments.

Now, your main objective for this assignment is to search [Observable notebooks](https://observablehq.com/) for data visualizations, see the search box on the top-right. Choose one that interests you. And perform an analysis of the visualization. Your analysis should address the following:

1. Provide a description of the data that is visually displayed. You should be able to identify what a data item represents, and list the data attributes. You should describe data in terms of the characterization we cover in class.
2. Provide a description of the visualization. What visual encodings are being used? You should break this down into graphical marks and visual channels, per class discussion.
3. What questions does this visualization help you answer? What about the visualization is effective in supporting your answers to these questions?

The visualization that you choose should allow you to provide responses to the above, and so an overly complex visualization might not be a good choice.

Furthermore, for points 1. and 2., your responses do not need to be 100% correct. Rather, you should **justify your answers**. So long as you make well-reasoned arguments, then your responses will be acceptable, even if they do not quite match up to the real data / visual encodings shown.

# Submission

You should submit your document to Brightspace.

# Grading Criteria

1. Provide Observable username or email associated with your Observable account. (15 points)
2. Include a link to the visualization that you found. (10 points)
3. Data characterization of the visualization. (25 points)
4. A description of the visual encodings employed by the visualization. (25 points)
5. The questions that this visualization is effective in helping you answer, and why the visualization is effective. (25 points)
