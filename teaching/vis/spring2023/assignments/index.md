# Assignments

Here you will find links to design critiques and programming assignments.

Design critiques may be completed using your preferred text editor, e.g. Microsoft Word is fine.

You will work on programming assignments in Observable notebooks.

When a programming assignment is posted, a link will be provided to the Observable notebook associated with the assignment. Everything that pertains to the assignment will be contained in the notebook: instructions, starter code, guidance for completing the assignment, data, and how the assignment will be assessed.

Now, the first thing you need to do is **create an account** with Observable. You should choose the **Free Individual** tier. After the first assignment, you will be added to the **Team** for this course, which will then allow you to edit notebooks in private. Working on notebooks, in private, is _essential_ for the completion of programming assignments.

## Completing Programming Assignments in Observable Notebooks

To work on a programming assignment, you first need to _fork_ the assignment.

As an example, upon visiting a programming assignment notebook, you will be presented with the following, where I have highlighted the fork option:

{% include image.html url="/teaching/vis/spring2023/images/assignment-fork.png" caption="Options" width=800 align="center" %}

When you click fork, you will be presented with the following:

{% include image.html url="/teaching/vis/spring2023/images/fork-visibility.png" caption="Options" width=600 align="center" %}

The visibility of a notebook is **extremely important**. By default it is selected as **Only you**. Keep this option selected, and click the blue **Fork** button. The following notebook will be created, and placed as **your own notebook**:

{% include image.html url="/teaching/vis/spring2023/images/forked-assignment.png" caption="Options" width=800 align="center" %}

In the above, I have highlighted the visibility of the notebook, e.g. **Only you**. You may now work on the assignment, and the notebook will be **private**. No one can access this notebook but you.

Once you have completed the assignment, you will need to provide myself / the TA access to the notebook. To do so, you should click the **Share** button (highlighted above). You will be presented with the following screen:

{% include image.html url="/teaching/vis/spring2023/images/assignment-share.png" caption="Options" width=500 align="center" %}

Under the **Public** option, you will want to select **Can view (unlisted)**, as shown. This will make your notebook accessible to anyone that has knowledge of the link (highlighted in Access). But the notebook is not **publicly listed**, e.g. were someone to visit your Observable account, they would not see this notebook listed.

On Brightspace, you should copy the link (highlighted near the top), and paste it in the submission field. No need to submit anything else for programming assignments on Brightspace.

To emphasize: **never select the Can view option** when sharing your solution. Anyone can access the solution to your assignment by simply going to your Observable home page. I can only treat this as a form of copying.
