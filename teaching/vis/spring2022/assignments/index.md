# Assignments

You will work on assignments - both programming and written - in Observable notebooks.

When an assignment is posted, a link will be provided to the Observable notebook associated with the assignment. Everything that pertains to the assignment will be contained in the notebook: instructions, starter code, guidance for completing the assignment, data, and how the assignment will be assessed.

Now, the first thing you need to do is **create an account** with Observable. This should be straightforward, but if you have any questions please let me know.

## Notebook Access

It is important to understand the different levels of access for a notebook.

### Private Notebooks

You can create a notebook by clicking the "New" button in the top right:

{% include image.html url="/teaching/vis/spring2022/images/observable-new.png" caption="Observable New" width=800 align="center" %}

Observable provides a number of nifty template notebooks. For full generality, you can select a "Blank" template:

{% include image.html url="/teaching/vis/spring2022/images/observable-templates.png" caption="Observable New" width=600 align="center" %}

When you create a notebook, by default, it is **private**. You can verify this private access by observing the "Edited" icon:

{% include image.html url="/teaching/vis/spring2022/images/observable-private.png" caption="Private" width=800 align="center" %}

You are the only one who can view and edit the notebook, assuming you are logged in.

### Published Notebooks

You can, further, choose to share private notebooks via _publishing_. Click on the ellipses in the top right, and a set of options will appear:

{% include image.html url="/teaching/vis/spring2022/images/observable-options.png" caption="Options" width=800 align="center" %}

By choosing "Publish", you can make your notebook accessible in one of two ways:

1. Accessible to the general public.
2. Accessible to _only_ those that know the URL.

{% include image.html url="/teaching/vis/spring2022/images/observable-visibility.png" caption="Options" width=600 align="center" %}

Per the above image, to _share_ the notebook with someone _only_ through its URL, and without making the notebook publicly visible, select **Unlisted**. Then, you can simply provide the URL for someone to access your notebook.

You can make the notebook private again by choosing "Unpublish".

## Completing Assignments in Observable Notebooks

Given an assignment's notebook, accessible as a **shared** notebook provided on the course website (of Unlisted visibility), to work on the assignment perform the following steps:

* Assuming you are logged in, _fork_ the notebook. In the options image above, you will see the "Fork" option. This will produce a **private** copy of the notebook, as part of your collection of notebooks.
* Work on your own forked, and private, copy. Changes that you make in cells will be automatically saved, assuming these cells have been _evaluated_. You are also free to remove cells that correspond to the assignment description, and assessment, if you like.
* Once you have completed the assignment, please submit the notebook to Brightspace. For this, simply _publish_ your notebook, choose the **Unlisted** option, and submit the URL.

One final note: **never make your notebooks publicly visible.** Anyone can access the solution to your assignment by simply going to your Observable home page. I can only treat this as a form of copying.
