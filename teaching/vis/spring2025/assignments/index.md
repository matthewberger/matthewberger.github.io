# Assignments

Here you will find links to design critiques and programming assignments.

Design critiques may be completed using your preferred text editor, e.g. Microsoft Word is fine.

You will work on programming assignments in Observable notebooks.

When a programming assignment is posted, a link will be provided to the Observable notebook associated with the assignment. Everything that pertains to the assignment will be contained in the notebook: instructions, starter code, guidance for completing the assignment, data, and how the assignment will be assessed.

Now, the first thing you need to do is **create an account** with Observable, which you will do as part of Design Critique 1 (see below). Once I receive your assignment submission, you will be added to the **Team** for this course, which will then allow you to edit notebooks in private. Working on notebooks, in private, is _essential_ for the completion of programming assignments.

## Completing and Submitting Programming Assignments in Observable Notebooks

To work on a programming assignment, you first need to _fork_ the assignment.

As an example, upon visiting a programming assignment notebook, you will be presented with the following, where I have highlighted the fork option:

{% include image.html url="/teaching/vis/spring2025/images/assignment-fork.png" caption="Options" width=800 align="center" %}

When you click fork, you will be presented with the following:

{% include image.html url="/teaching/vis/spring2025/images/fork-visibility.png" caption="Options" width=600 align="center" %}

The visibility of a notebook is **extremely important**. By default it is selected as **Only you**. Keep this option selected, and click the blue **Fork** button. The following notebook will be created, and placed as **your own notebook**:

{% include image.html url="/teaching/vis/spring2025/images/forked-assignment.png" caption="Options" width=800 align="center" %}

In the above, I have highlighted the visibility of the notebook, e.g. **Only you**. You may now work on the assignment, and the notebook will be **private**. No one can access this notebook but you.

Once you have completed the assignment, you will need to provide me with access to the notebook. To do so, first you should click the **Share** button (highlighted above). Once you do, you will be presented with the following screen:

{% include image.html url="/teaching/vis/spring2025/images/assignment-share.png" caption="Options" width=500 align="center" %}

As shown, you have the option to share your notebook with (1) the general public, (2) everyone in this class, or (3) an individual in this class. As highlighted in red above, please leave the options for (1) and (2) as **No access**. Otherwise, anyone can access the solution to your assignment; it will be visible on everyone's Observable home page.

To submit your assignment, select my name (Matthew Berger) in the "Search for a teammate" text box. Next, you should provide me with "view" privilege, so that I can view your assignment. Click the **Add** button on the right (this will show up as a clickable button). Last, click the **Save** button below to confirm your choice.

Sharing your assignment with me is how you will submit your programming assignment. There is no need to do anything else, e.g. you do not need to submit anything on Brightspace.

Further note that notebooks are time-stamped. I will use the date at the top of the notebook to determine whether an assignment was submitted late.
