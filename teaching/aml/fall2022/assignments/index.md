# Written Assignments: Instructions

For written assignments I expect you to typeset your submitted document using LaTex. Doing so will allow for clear communication, namely, in the mathematical derivations/arguments that support your answers. This will permit myself, and the TA, to easily comprehend your submissions.

You should use the [NeurIPS](https://nips.cc/Conferences/2021/PaperInformation/StyleFiles) template for document formatting. Please use the "preprint" package option for more readable formatting. You may find [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/) useful for editing LaTex.

Please submit your written assignments as compiled PDF documents to Brightspace.

# Programming Assignments: Instructions

For programming assignments, where relevant, you will be building off of boilerplate code that I have provided. In these cases, you _are not_ permitted to import any additional Python libraries as part of your code. You may only use libraries that are included as part of the assignment.

If you import any additional libraries, then you will not receive any credit for the assignment.

As part of your submissions, please provide instructions on how to run your code, as necessary.

Please submit all of the code pertaining to programming assignments as archived files (zip, tar, etc..) to Brightspace.
