# Programming Assignments: Instructions

For programming assignments, where relevant, you will be building off of boilerplate code that I have provided. In these cases, you _are not_ permitted to import any additional Python libraries as part of your code. You may only use libraries that are included as part of the assignment.

If you import any additional libraries, then you will not receive any credit for the assignment.

As part of your submissions, please provide instructions on how to run your code, as necessary.

Please submit all of the code pertaining to programming assignments as archived files (zip, tar, etc..) to Brightspace.
